This is a Rust project.

The script ./scripts/proctor is a convenience script that compiles and executes proctor. ALWAYS use this to run, NEVER manually compile and run.

Use the libraries already added in @Cargo.toml.

@README.md describes the design of this command-line tool.

We use todo2 for persistent task tracking.
